2. [Getting Started with Claude and Skills](dans-archive/02-getting-started-claude-skills/index.md) - This chapter covers Claude Pro accounts, the Claude Code interface, and introduces the Claude Skills system including skill definition, installation, and basic usage.

3. [Course Design and Educational Theory](dans-archive/03-course-design-educational-theory/index.md) - This chapter explores course descriptions, target audiences, prerequisites, learning outcomes, and Bloom's Taxonomy (2001 revision) with its six cognitive levels.

4. [Introduction to Learning Graphs](dans-archive/04-intro-learning-graphs/index.md) - This chapter introduces learning graph fundamentals, concept nodes and edges, dependencies, prerequisite relationships, DAG structure, and learning pathways.

5. [Concept Enumeration and Dependencies](dans-archive/05-concept-enumeration-dependencies/index.md) - This chapter covers the concept enumeration process, generating 200 concepts, concept labels, granularity, atomic concepts, dependency mapping, and foundational vs. advanced concepts.

6. [Learning Graph Quality and Validation](dans-archive/06-learning-graph-quality-validation/index.md) - This chapter focuses on graph quality metrics, DAG validation, circular dependency detection, orphaned nodes, disconnected subgraphs, indegree/outdegree analysis, and quality scoring.

7. [Taxonomy and Data Formats](dans-archive/07-taxonomy-data-formats/index.md) - This chapter covers taxonomy categorization, CSV file formats, pipe-delimited dependencies, JSON schema for learning graphs, metadata (Dublin Core), and color coding for visualizations.

9. [Claude Skills Architecture and Development](dans-archive/09-claude-skills-architecture-development/index.md) - This chapter deep dives into skill directory structure, supporting assets, Python scripts, templates, reference documentation, skill workflow instructions, commands vs. skills, and skill execution context.

10. [Content Creation Workflows](dans-archive/10-content-creation-workflows/index.md) - This chapter covers chapter structure, section organization, content generation processes, chapter index files, concept lists, reading level appropriateness, worked examples, and practice exercises.

11. [Educational Resources and Assessment](dans-archive/11-educational-resources-assessment/index.md) - This chapter explores glossary generation with ISO 11179 standards, FAQ creation from course content, quiz generation, Bloom's alignment in quizzes, and assessing student understanding.

12. [Interactive Elements and MicroSims](dans-archive/12-interactive-elements-microsims/index.md) - This chapter introduces MicroSims, p5.js library, interactive simulations, directory structure, iframe embedding, seeded randomness, and interactive controls.

13. [Development Tools, Version Control, and Deployment](dans-archive/13-dev-tools-version-control-deployment/index.md) - This chapter covers Git workflows, version control best practices, GitHub Pages deployment, continuous integration, and maintaining intelligent textbook projects.

## Chapter Organization

Chapters are organized in `docs/chapters/dans-archive/` and follow a logical progression from foundational concepts to advanced implementation. Each chapter builds on previous concepts, following the learning graph dependency structure.
